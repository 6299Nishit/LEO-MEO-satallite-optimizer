# LEO-MEO-satallite-optimizer
This project develops a Starlink-style LEO/MEO satellite communication optimizer using SDR, DSP, and machine learning. It predicts future link quality using Kalman filtering and LSTM to enable seamless satellite handover, reducing latency, improving reliability, and ensuring continuous connectivity.
